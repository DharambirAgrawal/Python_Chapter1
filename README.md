## Chapter 1: Python Primer Exercises
## Introduction
Welcome to the README file for the Python Primer exercises! This file provides a summary of the exercises included in Chapter 1 of the Python Primer.

## Exercise Descriptions
### Exercise 1: is_multiple(n, m)
This exercise requires you to write a short program called `is_multiple(n, m)` that determines whether `n` is a multiple of `m`. The function should return `True` if `n` is a multiple of `m`, and `False` otherwise.

### Exercise 2: is_even(k)
In this exercise, you need to implement a Python function called `is_even(k)` that checks whether an integer `k` is even. The function should return `True` if `k` is even, and `False` otherwise. However, you are not allowed to use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.

### Exercise 3: minmax(data)
For this exercise, you are required to write a program function called `minmax(data)` that takes a sequence of numbers and returns the smallest and largest numbers in the form of a tuple. You should not use any built-in functions for this task.

### Exercise 4: sqr_sum(n)
In this exercise, you need to write a Python function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of all the positive integers smaller than `n`.

### Exercise 5: sqr_sum_comprehension(n)
This exercise builds upon Exercise 4 and requires you to compute the sum of the squares using Python's comprehension syntax and the built-in `sum` function.

### Exercise 6: sqr_sum_odd(n)
For this exercise, you need to write a Python function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of all the odd positive integers smaller than `n`.

### Exercise 7: sqr_sum_odd_comprehension(n)
Similar to Exercise 5, this exercise asks you to compute the sum of the squares of odd positive integers using Python's comprehension syntax and the built-in `sum` function.

### Exercise 8: Equivalent Index for Negative Indices
In this exercise, you need to determine the equivalent positive index for a given negative index in a string. You should provide the formula to calculate the equivalent positive index.

### Exercise 9: Range Constructor Parameters
For this exercise, you need to write the parameters that should be sent to the range constructor to produce a range with the values `50, 60, 70, 80`.

### Exercise 10: Range Constructor Parameters
Similar to Exercise 9, this exercise asks you to write the parameters that should be sent to the range constructor to produce a range with the values `8, 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6, -8`.

### Exercise 11: List Comprehension
In this exercise, you need to demonstrate how to use Python's list comprehension syntax to produce the list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]`.

### Exercise 12: Implementing choice() Function
For the final exercise, you are required to implement your own version of the `choice()` function using only the `randrange()` function from Python's random module.

## Conclusion
These exercises cover various concepts and techniques in Python programming. Completing these exercises will enhance your understanding of Python and its capabilities. Good luck with your Python learning journey!
